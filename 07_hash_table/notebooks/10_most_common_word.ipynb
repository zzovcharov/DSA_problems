    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string `paragraph` and a list of strings `banned`, return the **most frequent word** in the paragraph that is **not banned**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is guaranteed that:\n",
    "- At least one word is not banned.\n",
    "- The answer is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison is **case-insensitive**, and the returned word must be in **lowercase**.\n",
    "All punctuation should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "paragraph = \"Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.\"\n",
    "banned = [\"hit\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"ball\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"hit\" appears 3 times, but it is banned.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"ball\" appears 2 times, which is the highest frequency among non-banned words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Words are case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Punctuation is ignored (e.g., \"ball,\" becomes \"ball\").\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "paragraph = \"a.\"\n",
    "banned = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 ≤ paragraph.length ≤ 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "- paragraph consists of English letters, spaces ' ', or one of the symbols: \"!?',;.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 ≤ banned.length ≤ 100\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 ≤ banned[i].length ≤ 10\n",
    "\n",
    "- banned[i] consists only of lowercase English letters"

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the most frequent word in a paragraph that is not in the banned list, we normalize the text, extract valid words, count their frequencies, and track the word with the highest occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "- The paragraph is **case-insensitive**, so convert it to lowercase.\n",
    "- Punctuation should be ignored, so extract only alphabetic words.\n",
    "- Use a **set** for banned words to allow fast lookups.\n",
    "- Use a **dictionary** to count word frequencies and track the maximum as we iterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the list of banned words into a set for fast membership checks.\n",
    "2. Convert the paragraph to lowercase and extract all valid words using a regular expression (`[a-z]+`).\n",
    "3. Initialize:\n",
    "   - A dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each word.\n",
    "   - Variables `bestWord` and `bestCount` to track the most frequent non-banned word.\n",
    "4. Iterate through each word:\n",
    "   - If the word is in the banned set, skip it.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, increment its frequency in the dictionary.\n",
    "   - If the updated frequency is greater than the current maximum, update `bestWord` and `bestCount`.\n",
    "5. After processing all words, return `bestWord`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lowercasing ensures case-insensitive comparison.\n",
    "- The regular expression removes punctuation and extracts only valid words.\n",
    "- The frequency dictionary correctly counts how many times each word appears.\n",
    "- Skipping banned words ensures they are not considered.\n",
    "- Tracking the maximum during counting guarantees that the most frequent non-banned word is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracting words takes **O(n)** time, where `n` is the length of the paragraph.\n",
    "- Counting words and tracking the maximum also takes **O(n)** time.\n",
    "- Overall time complexity: **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- The frequency dictionary stores up to all unique words.\n",
    "- Space complexity: **O(n)** in the worst case.\n"
