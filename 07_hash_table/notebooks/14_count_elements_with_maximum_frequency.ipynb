    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **total frequency of elements** in `nums` such that those elements all have the **maximum frequency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of an element is the number of times that element appears in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The elements 1 and 2 both have a frequency of 2, which is the maximum frequency in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total frequency = 2 + 2 = 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "nums = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- All elements appear exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The maximum frequency is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are 5 elements with this frequency, so the total frequency is 5.\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the total frequencies of elements that appear with the maximum frequency, we first count how often each number occurs, determine the maximum frequency, and then sum all frequencies equal to that maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a dictionary to count how many times each number appears.\n",
    "- Identify the highest frequency among all numbers.\n",
    "- Add together the frequencies of all numbers that match this maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each number.\n",
    "2. Traverse the array `nums`:\n",
    "   - For each number `f`, update its count in the dictionary using `freq.get(f, 0) + 1`.\n",
    "3. Find the maximum frequency by computing `max(freq.values())`.\n",
    "4. Initialize a variable `total` to store the sum of all frequencies equal to the maximum.\n",
    "5. Traverse the frequency values:\n",
    "   - If a frequency equals the maximum frequency, add it to `total`.\n",
    "6. Return `total`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "- The frequency dictionary correctly counts how many times each number appears.\n",
    "- The maximum frequency correctly identifies the highest occurrence count.\n",
    "- Summing all frequencies equal to the maximum gives the total number of elements whose values occur most frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Counting frequencies takes **O(n)** time.\n",
    "- Finding the maximum frequency takes **O(n)** time.\n",
    "- Summing matching frequencies takes **O(n)** time.\n",
    "- Overall time complexity: **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- The frequency dictionary may store up to `n` unique elements.\n",
    "- Space complexity: **O(n)**.\n"
