    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether the string `s` follows the given `pattern`, we must ensure a **bijection** between pattern characters and words in the string. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each pattern character maps to exactly one word.\n",
    "- Each word maps to exactly one pattern character.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "We track mappings from characters to words using a dictionary and ensure that no two characters map to the same word using a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split the string `s` into a list of words using spaces as separators.\n",
    "2. If the number of words does not match the length of `pattern`, return `False` immediately.\n",
    "3. Create:\n",
    "   - A dictionary `charToWords` to store mappings from pattern characters to words.\n",
    "   - A set `usedWords` to track which words are already assigned to some character.\n",
    "4. Iterate through the pattern characters and words together:\n",
    "   - If the character `c` already exists in `charToWords`:\n",
    "     - Check if the previously mapped word is the same as the current word `w`.\n",
    "     - If not, return `False`.\n",
    "   - If the character `c` is not in the dictionary:\n",
    "     - If the word `w` is already in `usedWords`, return `False` (violates bijection).\n",
    "     - Otherwise, map `c` to `w` and add `w` to `usedWords`.\n",
    "5. If all pairs are processed without conflict, return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dictionary ensures that each pattern character always maps to the same word.\n",
    "- The set ensures that no two different characters map to the same word.\n",
    "- The length check guarantees one-to-one correspondence between characters and words.\n",
    "- Therefore, the algorithm correctly verifies whether `s` follows the given pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splitting the string and iterating through elements both take **O(n)** time.\n",
    "- Dictionary and set operations are **O(1)** on average.\n",
    "- Total time complexity: **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of words or pattern length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dictionary and set can store up to `n` entries.\n",
    "- Space complexity: **O(n)**.\n"

    "## Rubber Duck Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given:\n",
    "- A **pattern** made of letters (for example: `\"abba\"`)\n",
    "- A **sentence** made of words (for example: `\"dog cat cat dog\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to check whether each letter in the pattern can be replaced by a word so that the sentence matches exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two strict rules:\n",
    "- Each letter can map to **only one word**.\n",
    "- Each word can map to **only one letter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a **bijection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Split the sentence into words\n",
    "\n",
    "First, split the sentence into individual words:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "words = s.split(\" \")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now the sentence becomes a list of words.\n",
    "If the number of words does not match the number of letters in the pattern, it is impossible to match them one-to-one, so return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Prepare memory structures\n",
    "\n",
    "You need two structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A dictionary charToWords to remember which word each pattern character maps to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A set usedWords to track which words are already assigned to some character.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps enforce both directions of the mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Walk through pattern and words together\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate through both at the same time:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for c, w in zip(pattern, words):\n",
    "```\n",
    "At each step, compare a pattern character c with a word w.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Enforce consistency rules\n",
    "**Rule 1:** Same letter must map to the same word\n",
    "\n",
    "If c already exists in charToWords, then the stored word must equal w.\n",
    "If not, the pattern is broken and you return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 2:** Different letters cannot map to the same word\n",
    "\n",
    "If c is new but w is already in usedWords, then another letter already uses this word, which breaks the bijection.\n",
    "In this case, return False.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both rules pass, store the mapping and mark the word as used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Finish\n",
    "\n",
    "If all pairs are processed without violating any rules, return True.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mental Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each letter gets one permanent word.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each word belongs to only one letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If either rule is violated at any point, the pattern does not match."
