    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A word is considered **uncommon** if it appears **exactly once** in one of the sentences and **does not appear** in the other sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two sentences `s1` and `s2`, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "s1 = \"this apple is sweet\"\n",
    "s2 = \"this apple is sour\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"sweet\", \"sour\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "s1 = \"apple apple\"\n",
    "s2 = \"banana\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[\"banana\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 ≤ s1.length, s2.length ≤ 200\n",
    "\n",
    "- s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- s1 and s2 do not have leading or trailing spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All words in s1 and s2 are separated by a single space."

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To find all uncommon words from two sentences, we combine both sentences, count the frequency of each word, and collect the words that appear exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a word appears exactly **once** across both sentences combined, then it is uncommon.\n",
    "- A frequency dictionary allows us to efficiently count how many times each word appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Concatenate the two sentences with a space in between and split the result into a list of words.\n",
    "2. Create a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each word.\n",
    "3. Iterate through the list of words and update their counts in the dictionary.\n",
    "4. Iterate through the words again and collect all words whose frequency is exactly `1`.\n",
    "5. Return the collected list of uncommon words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every word from both sentences is counted exactly once per appearance.\n",
    "- Words with frequency equal to `1` appear only once in the combined sentences, meaning they are uncommon.\n",
    "- The algorithm ensures that all qualifying words are included in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splitting and counting words takes **O(n)** time, where `n` is the total number of words in both sentences.\n",
    "- The second pass to filter uncommon words also takes **O(n)** time.\n",
    "- Overall time complexity: **O(n)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- The frequency dictionary stores up to all unique words, requiring **O(n)** space.\n",
    "- The result list also requires up to **O(n)** space in the worst case.\n"
