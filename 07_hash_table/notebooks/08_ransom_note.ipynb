    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether the `ransomNote` can be constructed from the letters in `magazine`, we count how many times each character appears in the magazine and then try to consume those letters while building the ransom note.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Each letter in the magazine can be used **only once**.\n",
    "So we track the available count of each character and reduce the count every time a letter is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an empty dictionary `countM` to store the frequency of each character in `magazine`.\n",
    "2. Traverse the `magazine` string:\n",
    "   - For each character `ch`, increment its count in `countM`.\n",
    "3. Traverse the `ransomNote` string:\n",
    "   - For each character `c`:\n",
    "     - If `c` exists in `countM` and its count is greater than zero, decrement `countM[c]`.\n",
    "     - Otherwise, return `False` (not enough letters available).\n",
    "4. If all characters in `ransomNote` are successfully matched, return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dictionary accurately records how many times each character is available in the magazine.\n",
    "- Each time a character is used for the ransom note, its count is reduced, ensuring no letter is reused more times than allowed.\n",
    "- If a required character is missing or exhausted, the function correctly returns `False`.\n",
    "- If the loop completes without failure, all required letters were available, so the function returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Building the frequency dictionary takes **O(m)** time, where `m` is the length of `magazine`.\n",
    "- Checking the ransom note takes **O(n)** time, where `n` is the length of `ransomNote`.\n",
    "- Total time complexity is **O(n + m)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dictionary stores at most 26 characters (lowercase English letters).\n",
    "- Space complexity is **O(1)**.\n"
