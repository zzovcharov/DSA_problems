    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `t`, return **true** if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or **false** otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **subsequence** of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (or none) of the characters **without changing the relative order** of the remaining characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"ace\"` is a subsequence of `\"abcde\"`\n",
    "- `\"aec\"` is **not** a subsequence of `\"abcde\"`\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "s = \"abc\", t = \"ahbgdc\"\n",
    "**Output:**\n",

    "- `0 <= s.length <= 100`\n",
    "- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`\n",
    "- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters\n",

    "## Follow-up\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are many incoming strings\n",
    "`s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 10^9`, and you want to check each one to see if it is a subsequence of `t`.\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the **two-pointer technique** to check whether string `s` is a subsequence of string `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "- Traverse both strings from left to right.\n",
    "- Use one pointer `i` for string `s` and another pointer `j` for string `t`.\n",
    "- Try to match characters of `s` in order within `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Logic\n",
    "1. Initialize two pointers:\n",
    "   - `i = 0` for `s`\n",
    "   - `j = 0` for `t`\n",
    "2. While neither pointer has reached the end of its string:\n",
    "   - If `s[i] == t[j]`, it means we found the next required character of `s`, so move `i` forward.\n",
    "   - Always move `j` forward to continue scanning `t`.\n",
    "3. After the loop:\n",
    "   - If `i == len(s)`, all characters of `s` were found in order inside `t`, so return `True`.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "- Characters in `s` must appear in the same order in `t`, but not necessarily contiguously.\n",
    "- The two-pointer approach ensures order is preserved while efficiently scanning `t` only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** `O(len(t))`\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is efficient and well-suited for the given constraints.\n"
