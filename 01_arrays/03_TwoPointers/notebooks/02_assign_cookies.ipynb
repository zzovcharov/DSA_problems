    "\n",
    "Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. Each child can receive **at most one cookie**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each child `i` has a **greed factor** `g[i]`, which is the minimum cookie size required for the child to be content.\n",
    "- Each cookie `j` has a **size** `s[j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cookie can be assigned to a child **only if**:\n",
    "s[j] >= g[i]\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to **maximize the number of content children**.\n",

    "## Approach: Greedy Matching with Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "To maximize the number of content children, we use a **greedy strategy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "- Always try to satisfy the **least greedy child** first using the **smallest available cookie** that can satisfy them.\n",
    "- This ensures we don’t waste large cookies on children who could be satisfied with smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort both arrays**\n",
    "   - Sort `g` (children’s greed factors) in ascending order.\n",
    "   - Sort `s` (cookie sizes) in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use two pointers**\n",
    "   - Pointer `i` → tracks the current child.\n",
    "   - Pointer `j` → tracks the current cookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate through both lists**\n",
    "   - If the current cookie `s[j]` can satisfy the current child `g[i]`:\n",
    "     - Assign the cookie to the child.\n",
    "     - Move to the next child (`i += 1`).\n",
    "   - Regardless of whether a match was found, move to the next cookie (`j += 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stop when**\n",
    "   - All children are considered, or\n",
    "   - All cookies are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return the result**\n",
    "   - The number of content children is exactly `i`, since `i` increases only when a child is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "- Sorting allows optimal pairing of smallest needs with smallest resources.\n",
    "- Each child and cookie is processed once → efficient.\n",
    "- This greedy choice leads to the maximum possible number of satisfied children.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time & Space Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "  `O(n log n + m log m)` due to sorting, where `n = len(g)` and `m = len(s)`\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:**\n",
    "  `O(1)` extra space (sorting in place)\n",

    "> “I give the smallest cookie that still makes the least hungry child happy.\n",
    "> Bigger cookies are saved for greedier kids later.”\n"
