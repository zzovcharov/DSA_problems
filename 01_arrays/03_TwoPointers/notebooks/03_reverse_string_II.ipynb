    "## Problem: Reverse String II\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.\n",
    "Reverse the **first `k` characters for every `2k` characters** counting from the start of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there are **fewer than `k` characters** left, reverse **all of them**.\n",
    "- If there are **at least `k` but fewer than `2k` characters**, reverse the **first `k` characters** and leave the rest unchanged.\n",
    "- Continue this process for the entire string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**\n",
    "s = \"abcdefg\", k = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "\"bacdfeg\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "- Reverse `\"ab\"` → `\"ba\"`\n",
    "- Skip `\"cd\"`\n",
    "- Reverse `\"ef\"` → `\"fe\"`\n",
    "- `\"g\"` remains as is\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "**Input**\n",
    "s = \"abcd\", k = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "\"bacd\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "- Reverse `\"ab\"` → `\"ba\"`\n",
    "- `\"cd\"` remains unchanged\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`\n",
    "- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters\n",
    "- `1 <= k <= 10^4`\n"

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We process the string in **chunks of size `2k`**, starting from the beginning, and apply the required reversal rules to each chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterate through the string** using an index `i`, jumping `2k` characters at a time.\n",
    "2. For each iteration:\n",
    "   - Extract a substring (`chunk`) of length up to `2k`.\n",
    "   - Reverse the **first `k` characters** of the chunk.\n",
    "   - Keep the remaining characters (if any) unchanged.\n",
    "3. Append the transformed chunk to the result string.\n",
    "4. Continue until the entire string has been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the chunk has **fewer than `k` characters**, slicing automatically returns all available characters, and reversing them satisfies the rule.\n",
    "- If the chunk has **between `k` and `2k` characters**, only the first `k` are reversed and the rest remain unchanged.\n",
    "- If the chunk has **exactly `2k` characters**, it perfectly matches the required pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — each character is processed once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — a new result string is built.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach directly follows the problem rules and keeps the implementation clean and readable.\n"
