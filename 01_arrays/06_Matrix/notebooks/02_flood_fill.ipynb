    "###  Flood Fill Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "An image is represented by an **m × n** integer grid `image`, where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value at position `(i, j)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given:\n",
    "- `sr`: starting row\n",
    "- `sc`: starting column\n",
    "- `color`: new color to apply\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to perform a **flood fill** starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flood Fill Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start from the pixel at `(sr, sc)`.\n",
    "- Change its color **and** the color of all pixels that are:\n",
    "  - **4-directionally connected** (up, down, left, right),\n",
    "  - Have the **same original color** as the starting pixel.\n",
    "- Continue this process recursively/iteratively until no more connected pixels qualify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the modified image after the flood fill is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "image = [[1,1,1],\n",
    "         [1,1,0],\n",
    "         [1,0,1]]\n",
    "sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[[2,2,2],\n",
    " [2,2,0],\n",
    " [2,0,1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the center pixel (1, 1), all pixels connected 4-directionally with the same original color are recolored.\n",
    "The bottom-right pixel is not recolored because it is not 4-directionally connected.\n",

    "### Approach: Flood Fill (BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store the Original Color**\n",
    "   - Save the color of the starting pixel `image[sr][sc]` as `orig_color`.\n",
    "   - If `orig_color` is already equal to the target `color`, return the image immediately since no changes are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize BFS Traversal**\n",
    "   - Get the number of rows and columns in the image.\n",
    "   - Use a queue to perform **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.\n",
    "   - Start by adding the starting pixel `(sr, sc)` to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Process Pixels Using BFS**\n",
    "   - While the queue is not empty:\n",
    "     - Remove the front pixel `(r, c)` from the queue.\n",
    "     - If its color matches `orig_color`:\n",
    "       - Recolor it with the new `color`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check 4-Directional Neighbors**\n",
    "   - For each pixel, check its:\n",
    "     - Top `(r - 1, c)`\n",
    "     - Bottom `(r + 1, c)`\n",
    "     - Left `(r, c - 1)`\n",
    "     - Right `(r, c + 1)`\n",
    "   - If a neighboring pixel is within bounds and has the original color, add it to the queue.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re explaining this to a rubber duck sitting on your desk.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Step 1: Remember the original color\n",
    "First, look at the starting square and remember its color.  \n",
    "This matters because **only squares with this original color should be repainted**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the starting square already has the new color, stop immediately — nothing needs to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Use a to-do list (queue)\n",
    "Create a list of pixels that still need to be processed.  \n",
    "Initially, the list contains **only the starting pixel**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this list as a checklist of work to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Process pixels one by one\n",
    "While the list is not empty:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take one pixel from the list.\n",
    "2. If it still has the original color:\n",
    "   - Repaint it with the new color\n",
    "   - Check its **four neighbors** (up, down, left, right).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Add valid neighbors\n",
    "For each neighboring pixel:\n",
    "- It must be inside the image boundaries\n",
    "- It must have the original color  \n",
    "\n",
    "If both conditions are true, add it to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the color to spread outward through all connected pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Finish\n",
    "When the list becomes empty, all reachable pixels of the original color have been repainted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the updated image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Ideas\n",
    "- Only 4-directional movement is allowed (no diagonals)\n",
    "- Only pixels with the original color are changed\n",
    "- Each pixel is processed at most once\n",
    "- The queue ensures all connected pixels are explored\n",
    "\n",
    "This works like spilling paint and letting it flow everywhere it’s allowed — no more, no less\n"
