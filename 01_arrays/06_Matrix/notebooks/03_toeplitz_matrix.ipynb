    "### Approach: Check if a Matrix is Toeplitz\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to verify whether every **top-left to bottom-right diagonal** in the matrix has the **same value**.\n",
    "To do this efficiently, we compare each element (except those in the last row and last column) with the element **diagonally down-right** from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔧 Key Idea\n",
    "A matrix is Toeplitz if:\n",
    "matrix[i][j] == matrix[i+1][j+1] for all valid i, j\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We loop through each cell except the last row and last column, and:\n",
    "- If any comparison fails, the matrix is **not Toeplitz** → return `False`\n",
    "- If all comparisons pass, return `True`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Step-by-Step Logic\n",
    "1. Get the number of rows and columns.\n",
    "2. Loop through rows `0` to `rows-2` and columns `0` to `cols-2`.\n",
    "3. For each `(i, j)`, check if the diagonal element `(i+1, j+1)` matches.\n",
    "4. If all checks pass, return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "By checking each element against the one down-right from it, we ensure all diagonals contain equal values without needing extra memory or checking each diagonal separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time & Space Complexity\n",
    "| Complexity | Value |\n",
    "|-----------|-------|\n",
    "| Time      | **O(m × n)** — we scan the matrix once |\n",
    "| Space     | **O(1)** — no extra storage required |\n",

    "\n",
    "Each element matches its diagonal neighbor → matrix is Toeplitz.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "We simply compare each element with the one diagonally below it.\n",

    "### Rubber Duck Explanation — *Toeplitz Matrix Checker*\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay little rubber duck, let's sit together and understand what this code is doing.\n",
    "Imagine we have a big grid of numbers — like tiles on the floor.\n",
    "We want to check if this grid is *Toeplitz*, which means:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **If you walk diagonally down-right from any tile, you should always step on tiles with the same number.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's what the code does, step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Talking to the Duck\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **We look at the whole matrix (grid):**\n",
    "   It has rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **But we don’t need to check every tile!**\n",
    "   We *ignore* the last row and the last column\n",
    "   because those tiles don’t have a tile diagonally down-right to compare to.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   In a 3×4 grid, we only check positions that allow us to peek at the next diagonal tile.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **We start scanning from the top-left tile.**\n",
    "   For every tile at position `(i, j)`, we compare it to the tile at `(i+1, j+1)`:\n",
    "   - If **they match**, great — we keep going.\n",
    "   - If **they don’t match**, uh-oh — the Toeplitz rule is broken,\n",
    "     so we return **False** right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **If we finish all checks without finding a mismatch,**\n",
    "   we can proudly return **True**,\n",
    "   because every diagonal has matching numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this works\n",
    "\n",
    "We're basically walking across all the *starting points* of diagonals and checking if each diagonal keeps its value consistent. If even **one diagonal is broken**, the whole grid fails the Toeplitz test.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like checking if every downward slide has the same pattern — if one slide changes color halfway, the playground inspector (you!) says it's not Toeplitz!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Duck Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "- We don’t need extra memory — we just peek and compare.\n",
    "- We stop early if anything is wrong — no need to continue.\n",
    "- The grid is Toeplitz **only if all diagonals stay the same**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you, little duck, can now proudly quack:\n",
