    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `i`th student. You are also given an integer `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the difference between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **minimum possible difference**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Input:** `nums = [90]`, `k = 1`\n",
    "**Output:** `0`\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- There is one way to pick score(s) of one student: `[90]`.\n",
    "- The difference between the highest and lowest score is `90 - 90 = 0`.\n",
    "- Minimum possible difference is `0`.\n",

    "All ways to pick 2 scores:\n",
    "- `[9,4]` → `9-4 = 5`\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the array**: Start by sorting the `nums` array in ascending order. This ensures that the scores we pick consecutively are the closest possible, which helps minimize the difference between the highest and lowest scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sliding window of size `k`**:\n",
    "   - Use a window of length `k` to check all possible contiguous subarrays of size `k`.\n",
    "   - For each window, calculate the difference between the last element (`nums[i + k - 1]`) and the first element (`nums[i]`). This gives the difference between the highest and lowest scores in that group of `k` students.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Track the minimum difference**: Keep a variable `min_diff` to store the minimum difference encountered as we slide the window through the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the result**: After examining all windows, `min_diff` will hold the smallest possible difference for any `k` students.\n"

    "Imagine lining up the student scores from lowest to highest. To minimize the gap between the highest and lowest scores in a group of `k` students, you always want them to stand **next to each other**. By moving a window of size `k` across the sorted lineup, you can quickly see which group has the smallest difference. It's like picking `k` closest neighbors in a line to make sure nobody feels too left out!\n",
