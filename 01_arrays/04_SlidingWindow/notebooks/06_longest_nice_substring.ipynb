    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A string `s` is **nice** if, for every letter in the string, it appears **both in uppercase and lowercase**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: `\"abABB\"` is nice because `'A'` and `'a'` appear, and `'B'` and `'b'` appear.\n",
    "- Example: `\"abA\"` is **not** nice because `'b'` appears but `'B'` does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string `s`, return the **longest nice substring**.\n",
    "- If there are multiple, return the **earliest occurrence**.\n",
    "- If there are none, return an **empty string**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"YazaAay\"\n",
    "Output: \"aAa\"\n",
    "Explanation: \"aAa\" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter in s, and both cases appear.\n",
    "It is the longest nice substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"Bb\"\n",
    "Output: \"Bb\"\n",
    "Explanation: The whole string is nice because 'B' and 'b' both appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: s = \"c\"\n",
    "Output: \"\"\n",
    "Explanation: There are no nice substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= s.length <= 100`\n",
    "- `s` consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.\n"

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check if a substring is nice:**\n",
    "   Define a helper function `is_nice(sub)` that returns `True` if for every character in `sub`, its opposite case also exists in `sub`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Divide and conquer:**\n",
    "   Use recursion to find the longest nice substring:\n",
    "   - If the string length is less than 2, return an empty string because a single character cannot be nice.\n",
    "   - Iterate through each character in the string:\n",
    "     - If a character does **not** have its opposite case in the string, split the string at this character.\n",
    "     - Recursively find the longest nice substring in the left and right parts.\n",
    "     - Return the longer substring from the two halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the original string if all characters have both cases:**\n",
    "   If the loop finishes without finding a character missing its opposite case, the current substring is nice, so return it.\n"

    "### Rubber Duck Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine each letter needs its \"buddy\" (the opposite case) to feel complete.  \n",
    "- If any letter doesn’t have a buddy, it splits the string into two groups around that letter.  \n",
    "- Then, we ask each smaller group the same question: “Do all your letters have buddies?”  \n",
    "- Keep splitting until all letters have buddies or the string is too short.  \n",
    "- At the end, pick the biggest group where all letters have buddies.  \n",

    "### Sample Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: `s = \"YazaAay\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with full string `\"YazaAay\"`.  \n",
    "   - `'Y'` does **not** have `'y'`, split into left `\"\"` and right `\"azaAay\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consider `\"azaAay\"`:\n",
    "   - `'z'` does **not** have `'Z'`, split into left `\"a\"` and right `\"aAay\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consider `\"aAay\"`:\n",
    "   - All letters have buddies:\n",
    "     - `'a'` has `'A'`\n",
    "     - `'A'` has `'a'`\n",
    "     - `'y'` has no `'Y'` → split into `\"aAa\"` and `\"y\"`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The recursion returns `\"aAa\"` as the longest nice substring."
