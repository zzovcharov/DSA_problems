    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed string `blocks` of length `n`, where `blocks[i]` is either `'W'` or `'B'`, representing the color of the ith block. `'W'` denotes white and `'B'` denotes black.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given an integer `k`, which is the desired number of consecutive black blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one operation, you can recolor a white block to black.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Return the minimum number of operations needed so that there is at least **one occurrence of `k` consecutive black blocks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- Recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks → `\"BBBBBBBWBW\"`\n",
    "- This achieves 7 consecutive black blocks with 3 operations.\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Window:**\n",
    "   Consider the first `k` blocks as a sliding window. Count how many white blocks `'W'` are in this window. This is the initial number of operations needed to make the first `k` blocks all black.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sliding Window:**\n",
    "   Slide the window one block at a time from left to right:\n",
    "   - If the block leaving the window is `'W'`, decrement the white count.\n",
    "   - If the block entering the window is `'W'`, increment the white count.\n",
    "   - Keep track of the minimum white count encountered in any window, as this represents the minimum number of recoloring operations needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Result:**\n",
    "   After checking all windows, return the minimum number of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:**\n",
    "We use a sliding window to efficiently check all contiguous segments of length `k`. The count of `'W'` in the window directly gives the number of recolors needed for that segment. By keeping track of the minimum, we find the optimal segment requiring the fewest operations.\n",
