    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a **harmonious array** as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of its **longest harmonious subsequence** among all possible subsequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be derived by deleting some or no elements **without changing the order** of the remaining elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].\n",

    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Count the frequency of each number**\n",
    "   Use a dictionary to count how many times each number appears in the array. This helps quickly know how many elements can be used in a subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify harmonious pairs**\n",
    "   A harmonious subsequence has numbers with a difference of exactly 1. Iterate over each number in the frequency dictionary and check if `num + 1` exists. If it does, we can form a harmonious subsequence of length `freq[num] + freq[num + 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Track the maximum length**\n",
    "   While checking each possible pair, keep updating a variable `max_len` to store the length of the longest harmonious subsequence found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the result**\n",
    "   After iterating through all numbers, return `max_len` as the length of the longest harmonious subsequence.\n"

    "1. **Counting Frequencies**\n",
    "   First, we count how many times each number appears in the array. This is stored in a dictionary `freq`, where the key is the number and the value is its count.\n",

    "2. **Finding Harmonious Subsequences**\n",
    "   A harmonious subsequence requires numbers with a difference of exactly 1. For each number `num`, we check if `num + 1` exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, the total length of this subsequence is `freq[num] + freq[num + 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tracking the Maximum**\n",
    "   Keep track of the maximum length of all possible harmonious subsequences while iterating through the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Result**\n",
    "   After examining all numbers, return the maximum length found.\n",
