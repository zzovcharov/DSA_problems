    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Sort the seats and students\n",
    "- Sort both the `seats` array and the `students` array in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "- This ensures that each student is matched to the closest available seat in order.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Compute the moves\n",
    "- Initialize `moves = 0`.\n",
    "- Iterate through all indices `i`:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  moves += abs(seats[i] - students[i])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Add the absolute difference between the ith seat and ith student to the total moves.\n",
