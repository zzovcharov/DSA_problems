    "## Problem: Image Smoother\n",
    "\n",
    "An image smoother is a 3 x 3 filter applied to each cell of an image.\n",
    "For each cell, we take the average of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the cell itself, and\n",
    "- all valid surrounding cells (up to 8 neighbors),\n",
    "\n",
    "then **round down** (floor) the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one or more surrounding cells are outside the image (e.g., corners/edges), we **ignore** them and only average over the valid ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an `m x n` integer matrix `img` representing a grayscale image, return the image after applying the smoother to **each cell**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: `img = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]`\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let `m` and `n` be the number of rows and columns in `img`.\n",
    "2. Create a result matrix of size `m x n` initialized with zeros.\n",
    "3. For each cell `(i, j)`:\n",
    "   - Initialize `total = 0`, `count = 0`.\n",
    "   - Loop over all neighbors using offsets `dx` and `dy` in `[-1, 0, 1]`:\n",
    "     - Compute neighbor indices `ni = i + dx`, `nj = j + dy`.\n",
    "     - If `(ni, nj)` is inside the bounds of the image, add `img[ni][nj]` to `total` and increment `count`.\n",
    "   - Set `result[i][j] = total // count` (integer division for floor).\n",
    "4. Return the `result` matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity: O(m * n * 9) = O(m * n)\n",
    "Space complexity: O(m * n) for the result matrix.\n"

    "3. Add up all these valid values and count how many you used.\n",

    "In the end, you get a new image where each pixel is the average of itself and its neighbors, making the image “smoother.”\n"
