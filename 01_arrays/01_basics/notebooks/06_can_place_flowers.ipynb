    "Given `flowerbed` and an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` new flowers can be planted without violating the rule; otherwise return `false`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Iterate over each plot in the flowerbed.\n",
    "2. When you encounter a `0`, check if both neighbors are empty:\n",
    "   - Left plot is empty (or you are at the first index)\n",
    "   - Right plot is empty (or you are at the last index)\n",
    "3. If both sides are empty, plant a flower by setting the plot to `1` and decrement `n`.\n",
