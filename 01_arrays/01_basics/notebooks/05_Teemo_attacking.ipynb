    "## Problem: Teemo Attacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Teemo attacks Ashe with poison attacks.\n",
    "Each attack at second `t` poisons Ashe for exactly `duration` seconds — the interval `[t, t + duration - 1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Teemo attacks again **before the previous poison ends**, the poison timer resets and the new poison lasts `duration` seconds from the new attack time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a **non-decreasing** array `timeSeries`, where `timeSeries[i]` is the time of the i-th attack, and an integer `duration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **total number of seconds** Ashe is poisoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: timeSeries = [1,4], duration = 2\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- Attack at 1 → poisoned for 1,2\n",
    "- Attack at 4 → poisoned for 4,5\n",
    "Total = 4 seconds\n",

    "- Attack at 2 resets timer → poisoned for 2,3\n",

    "0 <= timeSeries[i], duration <= 10^7\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If `duration` is 0 or the list is empty, Ashe is never poisoned → return 0.\n",
    "2. Iterate through each pair of consecutive attacks.\n",
    "3. Compute the time between attacks:\n",
    "   `gap = timeSeries[i+1] - timeSeries[i]`\n",
    "4. If the gap is **greater than or equal to** `duration`, then the full `duration` contributes to the total.\n",
    "5. If the gap is **smaller**, the poison overlaps — only `gap` contributes (since the next attack resets the timer).\n",
    "6. After processing all gaps, add the final `duration` for the last attack.\n",
    "7. Return the computed total.\n",

    "\n",
    "Think of each attack starting a poison timer that lasts `duration` seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walk through the attack times one by one.\n",
    "For each attack, ask your rubber duck:\n",

    "- “How long does Ashe stay poisoned *before* the next attack happens?”\n",

    "If the next attack happens *after* the poison ends, then Ashe gets the **full duration** of poison.\n",

    "If the next attack happens *while still poisoned*, the timer resets, meaning the poison overlaps — so the time from this attack until the next attack is the only new poison time we add.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep adding these contributions for every attack except the last one.\n",
    "For the last attack, we always add the full `duration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By thinking of it this way, we ensure we never double-count overlapping poison.\n"
