    "## Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch\n",
    "\n",
    "The school cafeteria offers **circular** and **square** sandwiches at lunch break, represented by numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `0` → Circular sandwich\n",
    "- `1` → Square sandwich\n",
    "\n",
    "All students stand in a **queue**, and each student has a preferred type of sandwich.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cafeteria has the **same number of sandwiches as students**, placed in a **stack** (top at index `0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules of the Process\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the student at the **front of the queue** prefers the sandwich on **top of the stack**, they:\n",
    "   - Take the sandwich\n",
    "   - Leave the queue\n",
    "2. Otherwise:\n",
    "   - The student moves to the **end of the queue**\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until **no student wants the sandwich on top**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **number of students who are unable to eat**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "students = [1,1,0,0]\n",
    "sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After multiple rotations and matches, every student eventually gets a sandwich they prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "students = [1,1,1,0,0,1]\n",
    "sandwiches = [1,0,0,0,1,1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After some point, no remaining student wants the sandwich on top of the stack, so 3 students remain hungry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 <= students.length, sandwiches.length <= 100\n",
    "\n",
    "- students.length == sandwiches.length\n",
    "\n",
    "- sandwiches[i] ∈ {0, 1}\n",
    "\n",

    "## Approach: Count Students Unable to Eat\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Idea\n",
    "We simulate the lunch process exactly as described:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Students wait in a **queue**\n",
    "- Sandwiches are taken from a **stack (top first)**\n",
    "- If the student at the front does **not** like the top sandwich, they move to the back\n",
    "- If **no one** in the queue wants the current sandwich, the process stops\n",
    "\n",
    "The final answer is the number of students **left in the queue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Put all students into a **queue** (using `deque`) so we can efficiently:\n",
    "   - Remove from the front\n",
    "   - Add to the back\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keep a variable `res` that tracks how many students are still waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each sandwich (from top to bottom):\n",
    "   - Try to find a student who wants this sandwich\n",
    "   - Rotate the queue **at most `n` times**\n",
    "     - If the front student does not want it → move them to the back\n",
    "   - If a student wants it:\n",
    "     - Remove the student from the queue\n",
    "     - Decrease `res`\n",
    "   - If after checking everyone no one wants it:\n",
    "     - Stop immediately (no more sandwiches can be eaten)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Return `res`"
