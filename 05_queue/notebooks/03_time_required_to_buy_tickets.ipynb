    "## Time Required to Buy Tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **n people** standing in a line to buy tickets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Person `0` is at the **front** of the line\n",
    "- Person `n - 1` is at the **back** of the line\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given:\n",
    "- An integer array `tickets` of length `n`, where `tickets[i]` represents how many tickets the `i`-th person wants to buy.\n",
    "- An integer `k`, representing the position of the person you care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each person takes **exactly 1 second** to buy **1 ticket**\n",
    "- A person can buy **only one ticket at a time**\n",
    "- If they still need more tickets:\n",
    "  - They instantly move to the **end of the line**\n",
    "- If a person finishes buying all their tickets:\n",
    "  - They **leave the line**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **total time (in seconds)** it takes for the person at position `k` to finish buying all of their tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",

    "```text\n",
    "tickets = [2, 3, 2], k = 2\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- First pass → everyone buys one ticket → [1, 2, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second pass → everyone buys one ticket → [0, 1, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Person at index 2 has bought all tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "Total time = 3 + 3 = 6 seconds\n",

    "**Input**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "tickets = [5, 1, 1, 1], k = 0\n",
    "```\n",

    "- First pass → [4, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only person 0 keeps buying tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total time = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",

    "\n",
    "- 1 <= tickets[i] <= 100\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate the ticket-buying process **exactly as described** using a **queue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key idea\n",
    "- Each person can buy **only one ticket per turn**\n",
    "- If they still need more tickets, they go to the **end of the line**\n",
    "- We stop as soon as the person at position `k` finishes buying their last ticket\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Use a **queue** to represent the line.\n",
    "2. Store **(tickets_left, index)** for each person so we always know:\n",
    "   - How many tickets they still need\n",
    "   - Whether this person is the one at position `k`\n",
    "3. Repeatedly:\n",
    "   - Take the person from the **front** of the queue\n",
    "   - Let them buy **1 ticket** (costs 1 second)\n",
    "   - If they still need tickets, put them back at the **end**\n",
    "4. The moment the person at index `k` buys their **last ticket**, return the total time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This directly follows the problem rules and guarantees correctness."
