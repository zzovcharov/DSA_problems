    "# Crawler Log Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "The Leetcode file system keeps a log each time a user performs a **change folder** operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list of strings `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the operation performed at the *i-th* step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file system starts in the **main folder**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Each operation in `logs` is one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"../\"**\n",
    "  Move to the **parent folder** of the current folder.\n",
    "  - If you are already in the main folder, you remain there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"./\"**\n",
    "  Stay in the **current folder**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"x/\"**\n",
    "  Move to a **child folder** named `x`.\n",
    "  - This folder is guaranteed to exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing all operations, return the **minimum number of operations** required to go back to the **main folder**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**\n",
    "logs = [\"d1/\",\"d2/\",\"../\",\"d21/\",\"./\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**\n",
    "Use `\"../\"` twice to return to the main folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "**Input**\n",
    "logs = [\"d1/\",\"d2/\",\"./\",\"d3/\",\"../\",\"d31/\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 3\n",
    "**Input**\n",
    "logs = [\"d1/\",\"../\",\"../\",\"../\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 ≤ logs.length ≤ 10³`\n",
    "- `2 ≤ logs[i].length ≤ 10`\n",
    "- `logs[i]` contains lowercase English letters, digits, `'.'`, and `'/'`\n",
    "- `logs[i]` follows the format described above\n",
    "- Folder names consist of lowercase English letters and digits\n"

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We simulate navigating the file system using a **stack** to represent the current directory path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each folder we move into is added to the stack, and moving up a directory removes the most recent folder from the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty stack to represent the current directory path.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterate through each operation in `logs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **\"../\"**\n",
    "     Move to the parent directory:\n",
    "     - If the stack is not empty, remove the top folder using `pop()`.\n",
    "     - If already at the main folder (stack is empty), do nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **\"./\"**\n",
    "     Stay in the current directory:\n",
    "     - No action is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **\"x/\"**\n",
    "     Move into a child folder:\n",
    "     - Add the folder name to the stack using `append()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After processing all operations:\n",
    "   - The number of folders in the stack represents how deep we are.\n",
    "   - The minimum number of operations needed to return to the main folder is the **size of the stack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Return the length of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- The stack mirrors the directory structure as we navigate:\n",
    "  - Entering a folder pushes onto the stack.\n",
    "  - Moving up pops from the stack.\n",
    "- The stack size directly corresponds to how many `\"../\"` operations are needed to return to the main folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — each log entry is processed once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — in the worst case, all operations are folder entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a straightforward **stack simulation** of directory navigation.\n"
