    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a **stack** to keep track of the valid scores as the operations are processed one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each operation modifies the record based on the most recent scores, which makes a stack a natural choice because it allows easy access to the **last added elements**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty stack to store the scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Iterate through each operation in `operations`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **\"C\"**\n",
    "     Remove the most recent score from the stack using `pop()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **\"D\"**\n",
    "     Add a new score that is **double the previous score**.\n",
    "     This is done by appending `2 * stack[-1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **\"+\"**\n",
    "     Add a new score that is the **sum of the previous two scores**.\n",
    "     This is done by appending `stack[-1] + stack[-2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Integer value**\n",
    "     Convert the string to an integer and append it to the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After all operations are processed, return the **sum of all values in the stack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- The stack always represents the current valid record.\n",
    "- Each operation depends only on the most recent scores, which are easily accessible from the top of the stack.\n",
    "- Invalidated scores are removed immediately, ensuring correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — each operation is processed once.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — the stack may store up to `n` scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a classic **stack simulation** problem, where the stack mirrors the changing state of the score record.\n"
