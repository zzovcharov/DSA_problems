    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate the game, we repeatedly need to pick the two heaviest stones, smash them, and possibly insert a new stone back into the collection. A heap (priority queue) is a good fit because it allows efficient removal of the largest elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Idea\n",
    "Python’s `heapq` is a **min-heap**, but we need a **max-heap** to always remove the heaviest stones first.\n",
    "We can simulate a max-heap by inserting **negative** stone weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Create an empty heap.\n",
    "2. Push every stone into the heap as a negative number (`-stone`).\n",
    "3. While there are at least two stones in the heap:\n",
    "   - Pop two stones (these correspond to the two largest weights).\n",
    "   - Convert them back to positive weights by negating.\n",
    "   - If the weights are different, push the difference (`y - x`) back into the heap as a negative number.\n",
    "   - If they are equal, push nothing (both are destroyed).\n",
    "4. After the loop:\n",
    "   - If the heap is empty, return `0`.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, return the remaining stone’s weight (negate the heap top).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`\n",
    "  Building the heap is `O(n)`, and each pop/push operation is `O(log n)`.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the heap.\n"
