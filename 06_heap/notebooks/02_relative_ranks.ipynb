    "## Approach: Relative Ranks\n",
    "\n",
    "To assign ranks to athletes based on their scores, we can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Store scores with their original indices**\n",
    "   We need to return an array where each position corresponds to the original athlete.\n",
    "   So we pair each score with its index:\n",
    "   `(score[i], i)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sort the list in descending order of scores**\n",
    "   Sorting will help determine the ranking order easily.\n",
    "   The first element after sorting has the highest score, the second one has the second highest score, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate through the sorted list and assign ranks**\n",
    "   - For the 1st highest score → `\"Gold Medal\"`\n",
    "   - For the 2nd highest score → `\"Silver Medal\"`\n",
    "   - For the 3rd highest score → `\"Bronze Medal\"`\n",
    "   - For the rest (4th onward) → their placement number as a string (e.g. `\"4\"`, `\"5\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Place each rank into the correct index in the result array**\n",
    "   Since we tracked original indices, we can store each athlete’s rank back in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return the filled result list**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)`\n",
    "- **Creating output:** `O(n)`\n",
    "- **Overall:** `O(n log n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Example Flow (score = [10, 3, 8, 9, 4])\n",
    "| Score | Index | Sorted Order | Rank Assigned |\n",
    "|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|\n",
    "| 10     | 0      | 1st           | Gold Medal     |\n",
    "| 9      | 3      | 2nd           | Silver Medal   |\n",
    "| 8      | 2      | 3rd           | Bronze Medal   |\n",
    "| 4      | 4      | 4th           | \"4\"            |\n",
    "| 3      | 1      | 5th           | \"5\"            |\n",
    "\n",
    "Final output:\n",
    "`[\"Gold Medal\", \"5\", \"Bronze Medal\", \"Silver Medal\", \"4\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "We sort athletes by their scores, assign ranks based on sorted order, and store ranks using original positions to produce the correct result array.\n"

    "## Rubber Duck Explanation: Relative Ranks\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, little rubber duck, let's talk through this problem like we're explaining it to someone who has never seen code before.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a list of athlete scores, and each score belongs to a specific athlete.\n",
    "Our job is to give each athlete a \"rank string\" based on how well they performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Like We’re Thinking Aloud\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **We start with a list of scores.**\n",
    "   Each number tells how many points an athlete got.\n",
    "   Higher score means better ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **But we can’t just sort the scores and forget everything.**\n",
    "   If we sort the scores, we lose track of who originally had which score.\n",
    "   So we attach each score to the athlete’s original position — like putting a name tag on it: **(score, original_index)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **We sort this list from biggest score to smallest.**\n",
    "Now the athlete with the highest score is at the front of the list — easy to assign first place!\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **We prepare an empty result list.**\n",
    "It’s the same size as the number of athletes, but all blank at the start.\n",
    "Each spot will eventually hold the rank of the athlete who originally lived there.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Now we walk through our sorted list, one athlete at a time.**\n",
    "- First athlete → \"Gold Medal\"\n",
    "- Second athlete → \"Silver Medal\"\n",
    "- Third athlete → \"Bronze Medal\"\n",
    "- All others → just use their ranking number as a string (like `\"4\"`, `\"5\"`, `\"6\"`...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we assign a rank, we put that rank into the `result` list *at the original athlete’s spot*.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **When we finish assigning all ranks, our `result` list is perfectly ordered**\n",
    "— not by score —\n",
    "but by the athlete’s original position.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **We return the result.**\n",
    "Boom — everyone has their proper rank attached, and the order matches the original list of athletes.\n",
