    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an integer array `gifts` denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose the pile with the **maximum number of gifts**.\n",
    "2. If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose **any**.\n",
    "3. Leave behind the **floor of the square root** of the number of gifts in the pile and take the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **number of gifts remaining after `k` seconds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "gifts = [25, 64, 9, 4, 100], k = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "29\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The gifts are taken in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After that, the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final remaining gifts are: [5, 8, 9, 4, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the total number of gifts remaining is 29.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```text\n",
    "gifts = [1, 1, 1, 1], k = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, regardless of which pile you choose, you must leave behind 1 gift in each pile.\n",
    "That means no gifts can be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the total number of gifts remaining is **4**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 ≤ gifts.length ≤ 10³\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 ≤ gifts[i] ≤ 10⁹\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10³"

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem efficiently, we need a way to repeatedly select and update the pile with the **maximum number of gifts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "- Each second, only the **largest pile** matters.\n",
    "- After choosing a pile with `x` gifts, it is replaced by\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\lfloor \\sqrt{x} \\rfloor\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "- This operation is repeated `k` times.\n",
    "- After all operations, we return the **sum of all remaining piles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structure Choice\n",
    "Python’s `heapq` module implements a **min-heap**, but we need fast access to the **maximum** element.\n",
    "To simulate a max-heap:\n",
    "- Store all values as **negative numbers**\n",
    "- The smallest negative value corresponds to the largest original pile\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Algorithm\n",
    "1. Convert all elements in `gifts` to negative values and store them in a heap.\n",
    "2. Use `heapq.heapify()` to build the heap.\n",
    "3. Repeat `k` times:\n",
    "   - Pop the largest pile (by removing the smallest negative value).\n",
    "   - Convert it back to a positive number.\n",
    "   - Compute the floor of its square root using `math.isqrt()`.\n",
    "   - Push the new value back into the heap (as a negative).\n",
    "4. After `k` operations, sum all values in the heap.\n",
    "5. Negate the sum to obtain the total number of remaining gifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "- Building the heap: **O(n)**\n",
    "- Each operation: **O(log n)**\n",
    "- Total time complexity:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  O(n + k \\log n)\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "- **O(n)** for the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures efficiency even for large values of `gifts[i]`, while strictly following the problem rules.\n"
