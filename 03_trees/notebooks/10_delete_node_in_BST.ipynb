    "# Delete Node in a Binary Search Tree (BST)\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the root node of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an integer `key`.\n",
    "Your task is to **delete the node whose value equals `key`**, if such a node exists, and return the **updated root** of the BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deletion process has two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search for the node** that needs to be removed.\n",
    "2. **Delete the node**, adjusting the tree to maintain valid BST properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "There may be multiple valid resulting BSTs after deletion.\n",
    "You may return **any** valid one.\n",

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a node from a Binary Search Tree (BST), we must follow the BST property:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All values in the **left subtree** are smaller.\n",
    "- All values in the **right subtree** are larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deletion operation consists of two phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Search for the node to delete**\n",
    "2. **Delete the node while preserving BST structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "We handle deletion using recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Searching for the Node\n",
    "\n",
    "We recursively traverse the tree based on the value of `key`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `key < root.val`, the node must be in the **left subtree**\n",
    "  → recurse left.\n",
    "- If `key > root.val`, the node must be in the **right subtree**\n",
    "  → recurse right.\n",
    "- If `key == root.val`, we have found the node to delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Deleting the Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the node is found, there are **three cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Case 1: The node has no left child**\n",
    "\n",
    "The node can be replaced by its **right subtree**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return root.right\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Case 2: The node has no right child\n",
    "\n",
    "The node can be replaced by its left subtree.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return root.left\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Case 3: The node has two children\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the tricky case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must find a replacement value that preserves the BST property.\n",
    "The standard choice is the inorder successor:\n",
    "\n",
    "`The smallest value in the right subtree.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find the inorder successor (minValueNode(root.right)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Copy its value into the node we are deleting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursively delete the inorder successor from the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the BST remains valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Returning the Updated Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "After deletion, return root so that parent nodes reconnect correctly.\n",
    "Eventually, the top-level call returns the updated BST root.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "- O(h), where h is the tree height.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Worst case (skewed tree): O(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Balanced tree: O(log n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "- O(h) due to recursion stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursively search for the node to delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply one of the three deletion rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No left child → replace with right subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "- No right child → replace with left subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two children → use inorder successor to replace the node\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return the updated root.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method preserves the BST structure and guarantees a correct final tree.\n"

    "## Rubber Duck Explanation: Delete Node in a BST\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay duck, let me explain how deleting a node from a Binary Search Tree works.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we remember the BST rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Left subtree → values smaller\n",
    "- Right subtree → values larger\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we're looking for a value to delete, we follow that rule down the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Searching for the Node\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duck, if the value is smaller than the current node**, I go left.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If it's larger**, I go right.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If it's equal**, I found the node we need to delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "That part is just normal BST search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Deleting the Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find the node, there are three possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Case 1: The node has no left child**\n",
    "\n",
    "“Duck, this is easy.\n",
    "If there’s no left child, I just replace the node with its right child.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Because everything in the right child is larger, the BST stays valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Case 2: The node has no right child**\n",
    "\n",
    "“Duck, same idea.\n",
    "If there’s no right child, replace the node with its left child.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in the left subtree is smaller—still a proper BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Case 3: The node has two children**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where things get interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a value to replace the deleted node that keeps the BST valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Duck, the perfect replacement is the **inorder successor** —\n",
    "the smallest value in the right subtree.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s larger than everything in the left subtree\n",
    "- But it’s the smallest value among all larger nodes\n",
    "- So it fits perfectly in the deleted node’s place\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Find** the minimum node in the right subtree.\n",
    "2. **Copy** its value into the node we're deleting.\n",
    "3. **Delete** that minimum node from the right subtree\n",
    "   (since we moved its value up).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Return the Updated Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "After deleting or replacing the node, I return the root back up the recursion chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "That reconnects everything correctly and preserves the tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Summary (Duck Version)\n",
    "\n",
    "> “Duck, deleting a node in a BST is just:\n",
    "> 1. Search for the node\n",
    "> 2. If it has 0 or 1 child, replace it directly\n",
    "> 3. If it has 2 children, steal the smallest value on the right and delete that one\n",
    "> 4. Return the updated tree\n",
    "> And the BST stays perfectly valid!”\n",
