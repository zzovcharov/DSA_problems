    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether two binary trees are leaf-similar, we need to compare their **leaf value sequences**.\n",
    "A leaf value sequence is the list of values of all leaf nodes (nodes with no children), read from **left to right**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be solved in two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Collect the leaf values of each tree\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a helper function `dfs(node, leaf_list)` that traverses a tree and appends the values of all leaf nodes to `leaf_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFS works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the current node is `None`, stop.\n",
    "- If the node has **no left child** and **no right child**, it is a **leaf** → append its value.\n",
    "- Otherwise, recursively visit the left subtree, then the right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we call `dfs(node.left)` before `dfs(node.right)`, the leaves are collected in correct left-to-right order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Compare the two leaf sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "We create two empty lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "leaf1, leaf2 = [], []\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we run DFS on both trees:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dfs(root1, leaf1)\n",
    "dfs(root2, leaf2)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "After traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `leaf1` contains the leaf sequence of the first tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- `leaf2` contains the leaf sequence of the second tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we compare the two lists. If they contain the same values in the same order, the trees are leaf-similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(n + m)\n",
    "Each tree is traversed once, where n and m are the number of nodes in the two trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(h) for recursion stack, where h is tree height.\n",
    "Also an extra O(k) for storing the leaf sequences (k = number of leaves).\n"
